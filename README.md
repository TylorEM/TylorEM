Hey, my name is Tylor Marshall. 
I currently work in the pediatric healthcare field as a Registerd Cardiovascular Invasive Specialist. 
Although my current career is rewarding and I am able to help children in need, I am diligently working on gathering the kowledgge needed 
to thrive in the development field. My self taught web development journey began in 2020, learning the basics of HTML 5, CSS 3, Vanilla Javascript,
and React, with the intent to eventually learn all the resources needed to develop full stack applications. The two specialties I feel the most drawn to,
and would love to collaborate on in the near future, are e-commerce and decentralized application (dApp) development.
